# Animated-Clock
An animated clock made with HTML, CSS and JavaSript. This was one of my first JavaScript projects.

The current date and time is set and formatted with JavaScript. This is displayed as a digital clock using CSS for styling. 

The clock is animated so it bounces around the screen with CSS animation. Please note, the animation doesn't work on mobile devices currently.

The background is styled with CSS using linear gradient.
